# Use-sentence-pooling-to-identify-writing-elements


Usually, students learn writing skills through writing their own essays in the school. To produce more powerful writings, it's important to understand how to segment texts and identify argumentative and rhetorical elements in writings. E.g. Which part is the introduction? Where is the thesis statement? Does one sentence belong to an example or a claim? Building an automated feedback tool to identify such elements in writings would be very helpful for students to learn writings, especially for those students who has limited education resources. In this project, we aim to build a Transformer based model to segment writings into different writing elements. We use a data set provided by Georgia State University on Kaggle consisting of 144,293 argumentative essays written by U.S students in grades 6-12. We choose the BIGBIRD Transformer model as the baseline and then investigate the architecture of model to improve the performance. We find that using our sentence pooling method could improve the F1 score from 52.8\% up to 58.8\%. The basic idea and novelty behind this method is to treat a single word NER problem as a sentence level NER problem, which is more suitable for this identifying writing elements task.
